title: "Beautiful email client for Ubuntu"
---

Just discovered [Geary](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Geary), a simple and beautiful email client for linux. Still in its early days but I think it has a great potential.

<!--more-->

Install it by running the following two commands

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yorba/ppa
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install geary
```

Shortcuts

```
[Ctrl+E] - Access Prefernces
[Ctrl+M] - Access Accounts
```

Works well with multiple Google Apps accounts.
It would be nice to be able to hide the top bar and just use shortcuts.
