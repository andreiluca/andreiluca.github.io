title: Things gone wrong after update

After some recent updates a lot of things are no longer working properly.
Touchpad, brightness level controls from keyboard, high cpu usage and temperature.
Also, for some reason only the first CPU core is recognized. Probably some other issues too but who has the patience.
I'm using an old laptop with the Intel i5 first generation mobile CPU and onboard graphics so might be a driver problem.

I decided to trash everything and install Ubuntu 14.04 and so far so good.

Here we go again!
