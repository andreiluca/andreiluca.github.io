After some recent updates a lot of things are no longer working properly.
Mouse, brightness level controls from keyboard, high cpu usage and temperature.
Also, for some reason only the first CPU core is recognized. Probably some other issues too but who has the patience.

I decided to trash everything and install Ubuntu 14.04

Here we go again!
