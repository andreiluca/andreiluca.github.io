title: "Power usage optimizer (TLP)"
...

If you are running Ubuntu on a laptop you might be interested how to squeeze more time out of its battery.

Recently I found out about TLP, you can install it by using the following commands

```
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tlp
```

TLP brings you the benefits of advanced power management for Ubuntu or other distributions without the need to understand every technical detail. It comes with a default configuration optimized for battery life, so you may install and just forget it.
